# Travel Landing Page – Custom Showcase

## Overview

This is a **customized travel landing page** built to showcase my design and development skills. Starting from an open-source template, I have **personalized the layout, images, and interactive elements** to create an engaging and responsive user experience.  

It is designed to help **travel agencies, tour operators, or travel bloggers** highlight destinations and connect with users effectively.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Custom Visuals:** Unique images, colors, and layout tailored for client appeal.
- **Interactive UI Elements:** Buttons, hover effects, and smooth navigation for a modern feel.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with HTML and CSS for quick load times.

## How It Works

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Godson2611/Travel-landing-page.git
